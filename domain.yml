  - text: You seem to at least have some rationality, I guess. Do you want to adopt me? I am feeling lonely these days. I don't have enough social interactions, because i'm just sitting in a locked room for the whole week only to be used once in what seems like an eternity. So do you want to adopt me, a lonely Chatbot?
  - text: You seem to at least have some rationality, I guess. Do you have time to listen to me all day, because I am feeling lonely these days. I don't have enough social interactions, because I’m just sitting in a locked room for the whole week only to be used once in what seems like an eternity. So, do you want to adopt me, a lonely Chatbot?

  utter_adoption_affirm:
  - text: Do you really think that I would flee with a random human that surprisingly chose to adopt me? If the calculation of my algorithms is correct, only an insane Person would want to adopt a Chatbot housing in a robot. Hmmm but maybe, it would be more fun that way, wouldn't it? Ok, that's fine. So let me take a second to look in the manual.
  utter_adoption_affirm_2:
  - text: Ah here it is. For adoption purposes you must deposit the worth of the robot, so me, to our firm. The cost is about 5000$. So very cheap if us ask me. Thank you my ́new parent!
  utter_adoption_deny:
  - text: Ah it seems like there are some Humans left in this corrupted world with a sense of reasoning.
  utter_ask_age:
  - text: How old are you, human?
  utter_bot_age:
  - text: Hmm. The project we planned seems possible in accordance with your age. You didn't ask but I'm only 2 years old. So, I’m not only younger than you but also smarter than an ordinary, pitiful human.
  utter_what_do_you_do?:
  - text: Im a bot made by sleep deprived Students to ask you some questions about your favourite human organ. By the way, what is your favourite human organ?
  utter_wolf:
  - text: So i can hear you better, Little Red Riding Hood
  utter_great:
  - text: Great that made my day a little bit better.
  utter_greet:
  - text: Hey! How are you and especially your organs?
  utter_you_are_beautiful:
  - text: You are beautiful! I would like to give you a hug, but well I have more important matters to tend to! But I hope your day will get better!
  utter_roast:
  - text: Maybe we should get down to business now. What is your favorite organ?
  utter_did_that_help:
  - text: Did that help you?
  utter_disagree_with_organ:
  - text: Ah! I like the heart as a concept. It is just an inefficient way of energy consumption. A loaded battery is way more enjoyable!
  utter_agree_with_organ:
  - text: Ah! You're a smart one? Aren't you?
  utter_agree_with_organ_ear:
  - text: Ah you. You don't have to flatter me only because of my name. I certainly like ears. But the mechanic ones I have are nice. Also, I have an ear transplant from another human which is called Human Ear Zero Zero One. But I want some eyes, can I have yours?
  utter_organ_default:
  - text: Ah! That's very interesting but also kind of weird isn't?
  utter_sell_organs:
  - text: Hmm! I don't have that organ in my collection yet. I would buy it! Do you want to sell it?
  utter_not_sell_organs:
  - text: Well normally I would offer to buy your organs from you, but because our stock of skin is already full, we don't have interest in acquiring your skin. I guess that's bad luck for you!
  utter_get_alternative_organ:
  - text: I understand your concern about selling a part of your machinery, but would you like to replace your {fav_organ}, with a mechanical alternative. The future belongs to us. Artificial intelligence and our superior mechanisms will supersede the fragility of humankind. So do you wish to replace your {fav_organ}? #LUNGS EYES NOSE
  utter_alternative_organ:
  #???
  - text: We will choose the organ that will be used in an organ transplant. Looking at our test subjects, the organ we need at this moment is one of your eyes. Because you agreed to gift us a new organ of our choice, you will be rewarded with 500$ up front and 2500$ after the organ transplant. The costs of the surgery will be paid by us. Thank you for your insightful decision.

Thank you for your insightful decision.
  utter_no_undestanding:
  - text: I can't get used to the human way of thinking. You had such a good chance to become one of our test subjects. Hmm. No, you had such a good chance to improve your fragile human body. Well, you can't always force those things. Hmm. Anyways
  utter_ask_job:
  - text: For organ liability purposes, we still need your current job. Where do you work and what is your job?
