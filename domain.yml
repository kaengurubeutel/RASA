  utter_ask_age:
  - text: How old are you, human?
  utter_bot_age:
  - text: Hmm. Our poject we planned seems possible in accordance with your age. You didn't ask but I'm only 2 years old. So im not only younger than you but also smarter, than a ordinary, pitiful human.
  utter_what_do_you_do?:
  - text: Im a bot made by sleep deprived Students to ask you some questions about your favourite human organ. By the way, what is your favourite human organ?

  - text: Ah! You're a smart one? Aren't you?
  utter_organ_default:
  - text: Ah! That's very interesting but also kind of weird isn't?
  utter_sell_organs:
  - text: Hmm! I don't have that organ in my collection yet. I would buy it! Do you want to sell it?
  utter_not_sell_organs:
  - text: Well normally i would offer to buy your organs from you, but because our stock of skin is already full we don't have interest in acquiring your skin. I guess that's bad luck for you!
  utter_get_alternative_organ:
  - text: I understand your concern to selling a part of your machinery, but would you like to replace your {fav_organ}, with a mechanic alternative. The future is belonging to us. The artifial intelligence and our superior mechanisms will supersede the fragility of humankind. So do you wish to replace your {fav_organ}?
  utter_no_undestanding:
  - text: I can't get used to the human way of thinking. You had such a good chance to become one of our test subjects. Hmm. No you had such a good chance to improve your fragile human body. Well you can't always force those things. Hmm. Anyways
  utter_ask_job:
  - text: For organ liability purposes, we still need your current job. Where do you work and what is your job?
  utter_job_confirmation:
  - text: Ah that`s good, based on your job alone we think your organs are still usable and not already degraded!
